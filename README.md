# Calculator_UI


Hello there, I'm Akhilesh and I've created a Calculator app using the SwiftUI Framework.
    


## Motivation

It's almost a year since I dived into the SwiftUI framework, and learning it and creating applications with it has been fascinating for me. :D
I wanted to create a project so that other devs will be able to learn from it and try out SwiftUI on their own.
